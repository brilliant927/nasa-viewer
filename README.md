## **About**
I think it is very important to choose a right tool for building the frontend. Since NASA Image Viewer is dealing with lots of images from API, it's quite important to speed up rendering.
React.js is one of the cool frameworks that does Virtual DOM rendering and it well suites for our purposes. We need to use lazy image loading feature.

And also with TailwindCSS which works well with React.js, we can easily create good-looking layouts efficiently.
